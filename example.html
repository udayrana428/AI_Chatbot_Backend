    <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, also known as a cryptocurrency. While not strictly a Real World
        Asset (RWA) itself, it&#39;s relevant to the RWA space because of its role in the broader conversation around
        tokenization and digital assets that <em>represent</em> RWAs.</p>
    <p>Here&#39;s a breakdown with an example:</p>
    <p><strong>What is Bitcoin?</strong></p>
    <p>Bitcoin operates on a technology called blockchain. This is a public, distributed ledger that records every
        bitcoin transaction. This decentralization means no single entity (like a bank or government) controls it. Key
        features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> No central authority.</li>
        <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> Secure transactions through cryptographic hashing.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Supply:</strong> Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency (with pseudononymity):</strong> All transactions are publicly viewable, though users
            are identified by addresses, not names.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>Imagine Alice wants to send Bob 1 Bitcoin. This transaction is broadcast to the network. &quot;Miners&quot;
        (computers solving complex mathematical problems) verify the transaction and add it to the blockchain. Once
        added, the transaction is irreversible and recorded permanently. Alice&#39;s bitcoin balance decreases by 1, and
        Bob&#39;s increases by 1. This entire process is transparent and verifiable by anyone.</p>
    <p><strong>Relevance to RWAs:</strong></p>
    <p>While Bitcoin itself isn&#39;t an RWA, its underlying technology and the concepts of digital ownership and secure
        transactions are being applied to tokenize RWAs. For example, a company might issue a token representing
        ownership of a fraction of a piece of real estate or other asset. This token could then be traded on a
        blockchain-based platform, offering increased liquidity and transparency compared to traditional methods. This
        is where Bitcoin&#39;s influence becomes relevant in the RWA space.</p>
